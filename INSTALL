1. Unpack the sources (seems like you got it already)

2. Configure the following paths for your setup. These variables 
   are located in the file tinyca itself.

@INC                    (location of the directory lib)
$init->{'opensslbin'}   (location of your openssl binary)
$init->{'templatedir'}  (location of the directory templates)
$init->{'zipbin'}       (location of your zip binary)
$init->{'tarbin'}       (location of your tar binary)

3. If you want to have german/spanish/czech/swedish texts:
   Generate the file tinyca.mo from po/de.po:
   msgfmt po/de.po -o locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/es.po -o locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/cs.po -o locale/cs/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   msgfmt po/sv.po -o locale/sv/LC_MESSAGES/tinyca.mo
   or even more simple: call make in the directory po/

   If your locale is not set to german/spanish:
   export LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=es_ES.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=cs_CZ.UTF-8
   or
   export LC_ALL=sv_SE.UTF-8
   before you call tinyca.

4. Call tinyca2, use it and report bugs :-))
